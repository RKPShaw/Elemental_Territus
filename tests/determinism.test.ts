/**
 * Golden master for the simulation.
 *
 * The engine's contract is that a seed, a configuration and an ordered system
 * list fully determine the world. These digests pin that contract to concrete
 * values so a refactor of how the world is stored can be proven not to change
 * what the world does.
 *
 * If a change moves a digest, the change altered gameplay. Re-baselining is
 * correct only when the gameplay change was the point; it is never the way to
 * make a refactor pass.
 *
 * Re-recorded when infrastructure gained memory. Every structure now carries
 * its builder's expressed element (structureHeritage — a new cell field, so
 * every digest moves by construction) and pays its current owner by how well
 * that owner's history covers the heritage's trade forms: native works pay
 * in full, legacy history pays 0.9, an incompatible network 0.78, and a
 * native captor pulls a resonant premium from freshly taken works while the
 * conquest is fresh. Theaters weigh heritage-matching enemy structures
 * higher, so wars now march for the networks their victors can run — city
 * income, every carrier's payouts and campaign priorities all genuinely
 * differ, and the map diverges with them.
 *
 * Before that, re-recorded when every trade form gained a carrier of its own. Land keeps
 * the road-and-rail network — its vehicles are convoys now, and the land
 * form's reward rides them; the waterway keeps its ships; energy realms
 * raise power plants that string straight conduits and pulse flat-value
 * deliveries down them; airborne realms raise skyports and fly freight
 * point to point over anything. Two new structures enter the shared trade
 * ladder and the exclusive carriers gate on the expressed form, so
 * construction programs, treasuries and the map itself all diverge from the
 * first planning window — every digest moves, and gale finally trades.
 * Tuned after the first hundred-game sweep of the carriers: air freight now
 * pays slightly under sea freight per travel tick (gale had taken nearly
 * half of all wins on flight income alone), and waterway realms open their
 * first harbor a factory earlier, because tide's coastal identity kept
 * arriving after its wars did.
 *
 * Before that, re-recorded when trade forms first went live riding the then-existing
 * carriers: trains earned the energy reward, stations the land reward, ships
 * the waterway reward, sea hosting paid a resonant share between realms
 * whose expressed elements trade the same ways, and construction leaned
 * toward the carriers a realm holds.
 *
 * Before that, re-recorded for the four-family roster and the live element system. The
 * founding roster reworked to twelve players in each of four families — grove
 * retired to an acquirable compound — so every draft, and with it every
 * world, differs from the first tick by construction. On top of that the
 * composed matchup table went live through each realm's expressed element
 * with absorbed-history relief (flipping the ember–stone counter and
 * neutralizing ember–gale and tide–stone), the ascension system began
 * awarding tier 2 and 3 expression from conquest tallies, war targeting
 * learned to hunt formability, and the opening partition's relaxation gain
 * rose so the smallest region opens inside its area budget under the new
 * capital draft. Cell digests and world digests both move everywhere, and
 * that is the point: this is the phase where the element space stops being
 * dormant.
 *
 * Before that, re-recorded when realms gained strategic priorities: element-seeded,
 * situation-bent weights that scale war desire, alliance appetite, trade
 * policy, commitment sizing and construction quotas. Every world digest moves
 * twice over — the strategy block is new state, and realms genuinely decide
 * differently. The cell digests tell the second half: seed 0x5eed01 still
 * holds its old tick-60 map while the others have already diverged, which is
 * the proof that priorities steer decisions rather than rewriting the ground.
 *
 * Before that, re-recorded when capitals became founded cities whose capture annexes the
 * whole realm, cities began to be sited on laid track, and trains took the
 * shortest physical line over track with a quarter of the old fleet. Every
 * digest moves, and that is the point: worlds open with fifty cities standing,
 * build differently, and wars now end at the capital.
 *
 * Before that, re-recorded when sea lanes moved from breadth-first hop counting to a
 * weighted distance search: merchant ships and naval invasions now sail
 * measured, coast-rounding routes instead of L-shaped staircases, so voyage
 * lengths, payouts and landing times genuinely differ. At the 200-tick gate
 * only the world digests move while every cell digest holds, which is the
 * proof that the change redrew journeys rather than the map.
 *
 * Before that, re-recorded when wilderness settlement began reading the theater map. Cell
 * digests move here, unlike the stage before it: settlers now press hardest on
 * the ground they most want, and what they want depends on what they believe
 * about the region around it, so the world genuinely plays differently.
 *
 * Before that, re-recorded when the theater map became world state. That adds a field
 * to the world, so every world digest moves by construction -- but the cell
 * digests did not move at all, which is the proof that stage one only builds
 * beliefs and nothing yet acts on them.
 *
 * The previous baseline was re-recorded when the frontier and border indexes began
 * holding their answers for the length of a tick rather than recomputing per
 * query. That is a gameplay change and it was the point: it also stops the
 * roster order from deciding who is scored against the freshest map. It was
 * verified in isolation -- with both snapshots forced to recompute per query
 * the engine reproduced the previous baseline exactly, which is what proves
 * the rest of the optimisation pass changed nothing.
 *
 * Checkpoints are shallower than the world's age would suggest. Fifty players
 * make a tick roughly forty times more expensive than five did, so the routine
 * gate stops at 200 ticks and the 600-tick checkpoints are opt-in:
 *   DETERMINISM_DEEP=1 npm run test:determinism
