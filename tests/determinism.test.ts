/**
 * Golden master for the simulation.
 *
 * The engine's contract is that a seed, a configuration and an ordered system
 * list fully determine the world. These digests pin that contract to concrete
 * values so a refactor of how the world is stored can be proven not to change
 * what the world does.
 *
 * If a change moves a digest, the change altered gameplay. Re-baselining is
 * correct only when the gameplay change was the point; it is never the way to
 * make a refactor pass.
 *
 * Re-recorded when capitals became founded cities whose capture annexes the
 * whole realm, cities began to be sited on laid track, and trains took the
 * shortest physical line over track with a quarter of the old fleet. Every
 * digest moves, and that is the point: worlds open with fifty cities standing,
 * build differently, and wars now end at the capital.
 *
 * Before that, re-recorded when sea lanes moved from breadth-first hop counting to a
 * weighted distance search: merchant ships and naval invasions now sail
 * measured, coast-rounding routes instead of L-shaped staircases, so voyage
 * lengths, payouts and landing times genuinely differ. At the 200-tick gate
 * only the world digests move while every cell digest holds, which is the
 * proof that the change redrew journeys rather than the map.
 *
 * Before that, re-recorded when wilderness settlement began reading the theater map. Cell
 * digests move here, unlike the stage before it: settlers now press hardest on
 * the ground they most want, and what they want depends on what they believe
 * about the region around it, so the world genuinely plays differently.
 *
 * Before that, re-recorded when the theater map became world state. That adds a field
 * to the world, so every world digest moves by construction -- but the cell
 * digests did not move at all, which is the proof that stage one only builds
 * beliefs and nothing yet acts on them.
 *
 * The previous baseline was re-recorded when the frontier and border indexes began
 * holding their answers for the length of a tick rather than recomputing per
 * query. That is a gameplay change and it was the point: it also stops the
 * roster order from deciding who is scored against the freshest map. It was
 * verified in isolation -- with both snapshots forced to recompute per query
 * the engine reproduced the previous baseline exactly, which is what proves
 * the rest of the optimisation pass changed nothing.
 *
 * Checkpoints are shallower than the world's age would suggest. Fifty players
 * make a tick roughly forty times more expensive than five did, so the routine
 * gate stops at 200 ticks and the 600-tick checkpoints are opt-in:
 *   DETERMINISM_DEEP=1 npm run test:determinism
