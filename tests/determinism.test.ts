/**
 * Golden master for the simulation.
 *
 * The engine's contract is that a seed, a configuration and an ordered system
 * list fully determine the world. These digests pin that contract to concrete
 * values so a refactor of how the world is stored can be proven not to change
 * what the world does.
 *
 * If a change moves a digest, the change altered gameplay. Re-baselining is
 * correct only when the gameplay change was the point; it is never the way to
 * make a refactor pass.
 *
 * Re-recorded for the four-family roster and the live element system. The
 * founding roster reworked to twelve players in each of four families — grove
 * retired to an acquirable compound — so every draft, and with it every
 * world, differs from the first tick by construction. On top of that the
 * composed matchup table went live through each realm's expressed element
 * with absorbed-history relief (flipping the ember–stone counter and
 * neutralizing ember–gale and tide–stone), the ascension system began
 * awarding tier 2 and 3 expression from conquest tallies, war targeting
 * learned to hunt formability, and the opening partition's relaxation gain
 * rose so the smallest region opens inside its area budget under the new
 * capital draft. The first hundred-game sweep then saw the trade-first tide
 * family eaten before its economy matured — zero wins in twenty-nine
 * resolutions — so tide's priority profile leans further into conquest,
 * defense and mastery, and the digests carry that tuning. Cell digests and
 * world digests both move everywhere, and that is the point: this is the
 * phase where the element space stops being dormant.
 *
 * Before that, re-recorded when realms gained strategic priorities: element-seeded,
 * situation-bent weights that scale war desire, alliance appetite, trade
 * policy, commitment sizing and construction quotas. Every world digest moves
 * twice over — the strategy block is new state, and realms genuinely decide
 * differently. The cell digests tell the second half: seed 0x5eed01 still
 * holds its old tick-60 map while the others have already diverged, which is
 * the proof that priorities steer decisions rather than rewriting the ground.
 *
 * Before that, re-recorded when capitals became founded cities whose capture annexes the
 * whole realm, cities began to be sited on laid track, and trains took the
 * shortest physical line over track with a quarter of the old fleet. Every
 * digest moves, and that is the point: worlds open with fifty cities standing,
 * build differently, and wars now end at the capital.
 *
 * Before that, re-recorded when sea lanes moved from breadth-first hop counting to a
 * weighted distance search: merchant ships and naval invasions now sail
 * measured, coast-rounding routes instead of L-shaped staircases, so voyage
 * lengths, payouts and landing times genuinely differ. At the 200-tick gate
 * only the world digests move while every cell digest holds, which is the
 * proof that the change redrew journeys rather than the map.
 *
 * Before that, re-recorded when wilderness settlement began reading the theater map. Cell
 * digests move here, unlike the stage before it: settlers now press hardest on
 * the ground they most want, and what they want depends on what they believe
 * about the region around it, so the world genuinely plays differently.
 *
 * Before that, re-recorded when the theater map became world state. That adds a field
 * to the world, so every world digest moves by construction -- but the cell
 * digests did not move at all, which is the proof that stage one only builds
 * beliefs and nothing yet acts on them.
 *
 * The previous baseline was re-recorded when the frontier and border indexes began
 * holding their answers for the length of a tick rather than recomputing per
 * query. That is a gameplay change and it was the point: it also stops the
 * roster order from deciding who is scored against the freshest map. It was
 * verified in isolation -- with both snapshots forced to recompute per query
 * the engine reproduced the previous baseline exactly, which is what proves
 * the rest of the optimisation pass changed nothing.
 *
 * Checkpoints are shallower than the world's age would suggest. Fifty players
 * make a tick roughly forty times more expensive than five did, so the routine
 * gate stops at 200 ticks and the 600-tick checkpoints are opt-in:
